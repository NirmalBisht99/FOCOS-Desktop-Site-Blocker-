# FOCOS(Site-Blocker)

FOCOS – Desktop Site Blocker & Focus App

FOCOS is a cross-platform desktop productivity application built using Electron, React, and Tailwind CSS that helps users maintain focus by blocking distracting websites for predefined time intervals. The application enforces time-based focus sessions, persists daily blocking state locally, and delivers completion feedback through in-app notifications and messages. A responsive, user-centric interface enables users to configure blocked sites, monitor session progress, and review focus outcomes. To demonstrate product flow and UX, a live web-based UI simulation is deployed, while core blocking logic and system controls operate within the Electron desktop environment.

Tech Stack: Electron, React, Tailwind CSS, Node.js
Demo: Live UI simulation (web) + full desktop implementation (Electron)
